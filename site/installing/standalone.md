title: Installing Weave Flux Standalone
menu_order: 20
---

Flux comes in several parts: 

-   the command-line client **fluxctl**
-   the service, which serves the API and
-   the daemon, which carries out tasks on behalf of the service.

Usually you would run the daemon yourself, and use the service that
runs in Weave Cloud. But you can also run both of these in your own
cluster.

## Quick Install

Install Flux and its dependencies on a kubernetes cluster with:

```
kubectl create -f ./deploy/standalone/
```

This will create all the deployments and services that are contained 
within the [standalone deploy directory](../../deploy/standalone/).

### Install the fluxctl client

Download the latest version of the [fluxctl client from github](https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/flux/releases/latest).

## Detailed description

The standalone deployment installs Flux and its dependencies.

### Memcache

Flux uses memcache to cache docker registry requests.

```
kubectl create -f memcache-dep.yaml memcache-svc.yaml
```

### Flux deployment

The Kubernetes deployment configuration file 
[flux-deployment.yaml](../../deploy/standalone/flux-deployment.yaml) 
runs the Flux service and the Flux daemon in a single pod.

```
kubectl create -f flux-deployment.yaml
```

### Flux service

To make the pod accessible to the command-line client `fluxctl`, you
can create a service for Flux. The example in `flux-service.yaml`
exposes the service as a
[`NodePort`](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/#type-nodeport).

```
kubectl create -f flux-service.yaml
```
